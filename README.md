Nuget packages needed for this solution are not included with the solution.  
This will cause the initial build to require an internet connection and take awhile.
Newer versions of Visual Studio or more specifically Nuget>=1.6 automatically update all Nuget packages in package.config so you will likely not need to do anything other than build the solution with an internet connection available to get the needed packages. Visual Studio Community Edition 2013 which this course was recorded with uses Nuget 2.8.

If you are experiencing problems or are using an older versio of NuGet please refer to this stackoverflow post:

Note: The Help-> About Visual Studio Menu option in Visual Studio will show you your current NuGet version.
